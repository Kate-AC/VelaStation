## For Developers

About the development flow
- Since Zealot has the design in mind, we ask them to create the screen design first.
- Once the screen design is done, the available programmer will implement it.
- When the implementation is finished, we send out a PullRequest. Please include a screenshot of the screen you have created.
- KateAC will review the code, Zealot will check the screen, and if there is no problem, we will merge.
- Deploy manually with the merged Vercel. (We will automate this process with GithubAction)

## Building the environment
- make build
- make run
- Access to http://localhost:53000/

I'm Japanese, but I use a translator, so English is no problem.  
By the way, Kate is a common male name in Japan and I am male.
